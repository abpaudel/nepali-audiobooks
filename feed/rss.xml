Aaja Ramita Cha is written by Famous writer Indra Bahadhur Rai. Nepali Novel Aaja Ramita cha is published firstly in 2032 BS by Sajha Prakashan. Now sixth edition is aviable in Market. This Nepali Novel Aaja Ramita cha is rich in humor, metaphor and colloquialisms. This novel is created in surroundings of Darjeeling.

In that sense, this novel offers a prescient glimpse into urban Nepali society as it has developed of late in Nepal. On both sides of the border, dreams of greener pastures abound: at one point Janak, returning from a trip to Nepal, chases a peacock he’s glimpsed off the trail to the border. “We humans may have left our own country,” he quips, “but if even the beasts and birds leave, how many days will Nepal remain?” Rai’s Darjeeling is inescapably Nepali, down to the small-town mentalities and the frustrated fatalism.

In Indravati, the sweat of fishermen and danuvars has been flowing for centuries. And so, its color is pure blue, to this day.

Ramesh Vikal wrote the endless story of the same fishermen who lived a miserable life relying on the same Indravati's neighbors instead of wandering in search of new means of livelihood. 'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan.

His character is to kiss the blue of the ocean with the first flow, avoiding the contingency of obstruction. In some rivers, life flows along with the water. In Indravati, the sweat of fishermen and danuvars has been flowing for centuries. And so, its color is pure blue, to this day. Holding Indravati's broken arm in her arms and throwing a net in the daha, playing ruthless Singauri with water, returning the dhuvali, tapping the bait and catching all the fish and ganga as a gift from Indravati from Udayachal to Astachal.

When the Sahu-Mahajans do not get bored only after losing their birauta, whether it is snowing the Indravati river or crossing the river to the passers-by in a boat, they save their livelihood. Ramesh Vikal wrote the endless story of the same fishermen who lived a miserable life relying on the same Indravati's neighbors instead of wandering in search of new means of livelihood. 'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan.

When the Sahu-Mahajans do not get bored only after losing their birauta, whether it is snowing the Indravati river or crossing the river to the passers-by in a boat, they save their livelihood. Ramesh Vikal wrote the endless story of the same fishermen who lived a miserable life relying on the same Indravati's neighbors instead of wandering in search of new means of livelihood. 'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan.

Nepali Novel Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati is Written by Ramesh Vikal Flowing is a feature of the river. Because that's his regularity. His character is to kiss the blue of the ocean with the first flow, avoiding the contingency of obstruction. In some rivers, life flows along with the water. In Indravati, the sweat of fishermen and danuvars has been flowing for centuries. And so, its color is pure blue, to this day. Holding Indravati's broken arm in her arms and throwing a net in the daha, playing ruthless Singauri with water, returning the dhuvali, tapping the bait and catching all the fish and ganga as a gift from Indravati from Udayachal to Astachal.

When the Sahu-Mahajans do not get bored only after losing their birauta, whether it is snowing the Indravati river or crossing the river to the passers-by in a boat, they save their livelihood. Ramesh Vikal wrote the endless story of the same fishermen who lived a miserable life relying on the same Indravati's neighbors instead of wandering in search of new means of livelihood. 'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan.

Nepali Novel Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati is Written by Ramesh Vikal Flowing is a feature of the river. Because that's his regularity. His character is to kiss the blue of the ocean with the first flow, avoiding the contingency of obstruction. In some rivers, life flows along with the water. In Indravati, the sweat of fishermen and danuvars has been flowing for centuries. And so, its color is pure blue, to this day. Holding Indravati's broken arm in her arms and throwing a net in the daha, playing ruthless Singauri with water, returning the dhuvali, tapping the bait and catching all the fish and ganga as a gift from Indravati from Udayachal to Astachal.

Ramesh Vikal wrote the endless story of the same fishermen who lived a miserable life relying on the same Indravati's neighbors instead of wandering in search of new means of livelihood. 'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan.

Nepali Novel Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati is Written by Ramesh Vikal Flowing is a feature of the river. Because that's his regularity. His character is to kiss the blue of the ocean with the first flow, avoiding the contingency of obstruction. In some rivers, life flows along with the water. In Indravati, the sweat of fishermen and danuvars has been flowing for centuries. And so, its color is pure blue, to this day. Holding Indravati's broken arm in her arms and throwing a net in the daha, playing ruthless Singauri with water, returning the dhuvali, tapping the bait and catching all the fish and ganga as a gift from Indravati from Udayachal to Astachal.

'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan.

Nepali Novel Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati is Written by Ramesh Vikal Flowing is a feature of the river. Because that's his regularity. His character is to kiss the blue of the ocean with the first flow, avoiding the contingency of obstruction. In some rivers, life flows along with the water. In Indravati, the sweat of fishermen and danuvars has been flowing for centuries. And so, its color is pure blue, to this day. Holding Indravati's broken arm in her arms and throwing a net in the daha, playing ruthless Singauri with water, returning the dhuvali, tapping the bait and catching all the fish and ganga as a gift from Indravati from Udayachal to Astachal.

Nepali Novel Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati is Written by Ramesh Vikal Flowing is a feature of the river. Because that's his regularity. His character is to kiss the blue of the ocean with the first flow, avoiding the contingency of obstruction. In some rivers, life flows along with the water. In Indravati, the sweat of fishermen and danuvars has been flowing for centuries. And so, its color is pure blue, to this day. Holding Indravati's broken arm in her arms and throwing a net in the daha, playing ruthless Singauri with water, returning the dhuvali, tapping the bait and catching all the fish and ganga as a gift from Indravati from Udayachal to Astachal.

When the Sahu-Mahajans do not get bored only after losing their birauta, whether it is snowing the Indravati river or crossing the river to the passers-by in a boat, they save their livelihood. Ramesh Vikal wrote the endless story of the same fishermen who lived a miserable life relying on the same Indravati's neighbors instead of wandering in search of new means of livelihood. 'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan.

Nepali Novel Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati is Written by Ramesh Vikal Flowing is a feature of the river. Because that's his regularity. His character is to kiss the blue of the ocean with the first flow, avoiding the contingency of obstruction. In some rivers, life flows along with the water. In Indravati, the sweat of fishermen and danuvars has been flowing for centuries. And so, its color is pure blue, to this day. Holding Indravati's broken arm in her arms and throwing a net in the daha, playing ruthless Singauri with water, returning the dhuvali, tapping the bait and catching all the fish and ganga as a gift from Indravati from Udayachal to Astachal.

When the Sahu-Mahajans do not get bored only after losing their birauta, whether it is snowing the Indravati river or crossing the river to the passers-by in a boat, they save their livelihood. Ramesh Vikal wrote the endless story of the same fishermen who lived a miserable life relying on the same Indravati's neighbors instead of wandering in search of new means of livelihood. 'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan.

When the Sahu-Mahajans do not get bored only after losing their birauta, whether it is snowing the Indravati river or crossing the river to the passers-by in a boat, they save their livelihood. Ramesh Vikal wrote the endless story of the same fishermen who lived a miserable life relying on the same Indravati's neighbors instead of wandering in search of new means of livelihood. 'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan.

Nepali Novel Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati is Written by Ramesh Vikal Flowing is a feature of the river. Because that's his regularity. His character is to kiss the blue of the ocean with the first flow, avoiding the contingency of obstruction. In some rivers, life flows along with the water. In Indravati, the sweat of fishermen and danuvars has been flowing for centuries. And so, its color is pure blue, to this day. Holding Indravati's broken arm in her arms and throwing a net in the daha, playing ruthless Singauri with water, returning the dhuvali, tapping the bait and catching all the fish and ganga as a gift from Indravati from Udayachal to Astachal.

When the Sahu-Mahajans do not get bored only after losing their birauta, whether it is snowing the Indravati river or crossing the river to the passers-by in a boat, they save their livelihood. Ramesh Vikal wrote the endless story of the same fishermen who lived a miserable life relying on the same Indravati's neighbors instead of wandering in search of new means of livelihood. 'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan.

Nepali Novel Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati is Written by Ramesh Vikal Flowing is a feature of the river. Because that's his regularity. His character is to kiss the blue of the ocean with the first flow, avoiding the contingency of obstruction. In some rivers, life flows along with the water. In Indravati, the sweat of fishermen and danuvars has been flowing for centuries. And so, its color is pure blue, to this day. Holding Indravati's broken arm in her arms and throwing a net in the daha, playing ruthless Singauri with water, returning the dhuvali, tapping the bait and catching all the fish and ganga as a gift from Indravati from Udayachal to Astachal.

Ramesh Vikal wrote the endless story of the same fishermen who lived a miserable life relying on the same Indravati's neighbors instead of wandering in search of new means of livelihood. 'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan.

Nepali Novel Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati is Written by Ramesh Vikal Flowing is a feature of the river. Because that's his regularity. His character is to kiss the blue of the ocean with the first flow, avoiding the contingency of obstruction. In some rivers, life flows along with the water. In Indravati, the sweat of fishermen and danuvars has been flowing for centuries. And so, its color is pure blue, to this day. Holding Indravati's broken arm in her arms and throwing a net in the daha, playing ruthless Singauri with water, returning the dhuvali, tapping the bait and catching all the fish and ganga as a gift from Indravati from Udayachal to Astachal.

'Aviral Bagdach Indravati' is the same sad story. It is the life of fishermen living from Sipaghat to Dolalghat. Vikal, who has been closely watching the innocent pleas of fishermen to make a living from Sahumahajan, has been struggling to write his stories since the 1930s. And so, Vikal says in the novel, "I looked closely at the life of a fisherman who cries and laughs for the existence of the land on the banks of the river Indravati. That is the gross expression - the novel 'Abiral Bagdacha Indrawati.' "Aviral Bagdach Indravati" is a Nepali language novel written by Ramesh Vikal and brought to the market by Sajha Prakashan. (Source: "Yasri Aviral Bagyo Indravati" Review Baharkhari.com) An audio book version in the voice of Khagendra Nepali has been collected.

Everest, visually illustrates every step of the way. This is the height of the writer's power and imagination. Although Lhotse, Nupche, Changte, Khumbatse and Pumori stoves can be seen from the base camp, we know that Mount Everest is not visible. For me, having only seen / touched snow and hail in the name of snow in my life, the risk of climbing the stove and wrestling with snow that earns my heart grows thorns in the side. Snow and snow are different things, and snow and mountains are different things. He takes the porters to the base camp at an altitude of 5300 meters at the foot of Khumbu Ice Fruit. "There was no loss of life in the expedition, only a few porters died," he said. Humanism is his weapon, like an avalanche that has to be buried in the rocky snow. With the longing to fill the deepest pit of sorrow, the porters at the foot of the highest peak feel different strands of sorrow in themselves. There are six porters in the base camp who are forced to pay for the treatment of their sick father, who have been deceived to teach their children, and who have run to Ranaha to meet the needs of the household. In order to stop him, he shares the citamole of the philosophy that 'there is sorrow in life, but life is not sorrow'. Reminding the fellow traveler of the simplicity of life, can he advance his ascent in a straight line? Can he consciously end that journey by saying, 'The journey of the stove is not the journey of unconsciousness'? These Audio of Chuli are taken from Archive.org which is uploaded by Shrabya Kitab.

Nepali Upanyash :- Radha Writer :- Krishna Dharabasi Programme : Shruti Sambeg (Ujjyallo 90 Network) RJ :- Achyut Ghimire Radha Written by Krishna Dharabasi It's been two years since Krishna Dharabasi wrote Radha, an extraordinary novel, and yet, the novel is still relatively unknown among litterateurs and the general public. Radha is a strong example of a novelist challenging traditional mores by presenting mythical texts in a different light. Inspired by Jacques Derrida's Theory of Deconstruction, he has completely changed the characters of Radha and Krishna as we have come to know them. Ved Vyas' and the Mahabharat's Radha is a minor character, whose only purpose seems to be Krishna's plaything. But Dharabasi's Radha is brave, dignified and can also be seen as a revolutionary. He keeps focusing on the importance of women, which too can be seen as a challenge to formal traditions. Krishna Dharabasi won the Nepal's prestigious Literary Award Madan Puraskar from this Novel Radha. Listen Radha Online Play the episodes of Radha by Krishna Dharabasi and enjoy listening Radha.

Nepali Upanyash :- Radha Writer :- Krishna Dharabasi Programme : Shruti Sambeg (Ujjyallo 90 Network) RJ :- Achyut Ghimire Radha Written by Krishna Dharabasi It's been two years since Krishna Dharabasi wrote Radha, an extraordinary novel, and yet, the novel is still relatively unknown among litterateurs and the general public. Radha is a strong example of a novelist challenging traditional mores by presenting mythical texts in a different light. Inspired by Jacques Derrida's Theory of Deconstruction, he has completely changed the characters of Radha and Krishna as we have come to know them. Ved Vyas' and the Mahabharat's Radha is a minor character, whose only purpose seems to be Krishna's plaything. But Dharabasi's Radha is brave, dignified and can also be seen as a revolutionary. He keeps focusing on the importance of women, which too can be seen as a challenge to formal traditions. Krishna Dharabasi won the Nepal's prestigious Literary Award Madan Puraskar from this Novel Radha. Listen Radha Online Play the episodes of Radha by Krishna Dharabasi and enjoy listening Radha.

Novel Taap is written by Sharda Sharma. Taap refers to the power of scorching heat or the power gained from struggle. Another thing is that people learn and experience Taap from the lessons learned from the struggles of their lives, suffering from the supernatural, material and spiritual. As the Taap subsides, people are still gaining energy. That is why it is said that life is struggle, struggle is life. The experiences of a character in the course of his life are the subject matter of a novel. Basically, this novel seeks to highlight various aspects of feminism. As the author is also a woman, the issues of feminism are significant and she has also highlighted the male tendency. The disgusting deeds of a man in a dignified position like a minister are expressed through a novel. Evidence of how inferior a person can be without regard to his position is evident in the novel. Although the author is a woman, she seems to have studied male tendencies very deeply. The important aspect of the novel is that it easily presents the male attitude. We have got the impression that such characters in the recent Nepali political sky also belong to Salva. One of the characters in the novel develops hatred towards people while living, and, the conclusion of those characters towards people is as follows: - 'Perhaps people are animals with the mask of civilization.' It can be done. Sharma's collection of travel essays on 'Land of Flowers' is also excellent. Considering the uniqueness of her writing, Sharma can be counted among the top five women writers in Nepali literature. Listen Taap You can listen Taap in Hamro Awaz. Select episode and listen Taap.

The disgusting deeds of a man in a dignified position like a minister are expressed through a novel. Evidence of how inferior a person can be without regard to his position is evident in the novel. Although the author is a woman, she seems to have studied male tendencies very deeply. The important aspect of the novel is that it easily presents the male attitude. We have got the impression that such characters in the recent Nepali political sky also belong to Salva. One of the characters in the novel develops hatred towards people while living, and, the conclusion of those characters towards people is as follows: - 'Perhaps people are animals with the mask of civilization.' It can be done. Sharma's collection of travel essays on 'Land of Flowers' is also excellent. Considering the uniqueness of her writing, Sharma can be counted among the top five women writers in Nepali literature. Listen Taap You can listen Taap in Hamro Awaz. Select episode and listen Taap.

As the Taap subsides, people are still gaining energy. That is why it is said that life is struggle, struggle is life. The experiences of a character in the course of his life are the subject matter of a novel. Basically, this novel seeks to highlight various aspects of feminism. As the author is also a woman, the issues of feminism are significant and she has also highlighted the male tendency. The disgusting deeds of a man in a dignified position like a minister are expressed through a novel. Evidence of how inferior a person can be without regard to his position is evident in the novel. Although the author is a woman, she seems to have studied male tendencies very deeply. The important aspect of the novel is that it easily presents the male attitude. We have got the impression that such characters in the recent Nepali political sky also belong to Salva. One of the characters in the novel develops hatred towards people while living, and, the conclusion of those characters towards people is as follows: - 'Perhaps people are animals with the mask of civilization.' It can be done. Sharma's collection of travel essays on 'Land of Flowers' is also excellent. Considering the uniqueness of her writing, Sharma can be counted among the top five women writers in Nepali literature. Listen Taap You can listen Taap in Hamro Awaz. Select episode and listen Taap.

An audio book version of Achyut Ghimire has been collected. The book is about Erika who goes to Nepal to treat the Nepali queens at the time of Tribhuvan. She ends up befriending King Tribhuvan (and teaches him to dance along the way), and helping him to come in contact with the Indian Ambassador, in order for him to flee Nepal and come back and end the Rana regime. Its not a story that most Nepalese know, so I'm sure that if they read it, they will come to know something that they didn't know and would be thankful to the book for telling this lost story.

Dedicated to those who love is a crazy lover's book - 'Unica' novel. This is the first narrative work of Ghanshyam Pathik, a poet and ghazal writer who has made a name for himself in the field of poetry and ghazal. Two collections of ghazals, 'Shahar Timro Bhaye' and 'Bhool Zindagi Ko' and a collection of poems 'Pahelo Phool O Swapna' are the works published before Pathik's novel. Pathik Damak, who is also involved in teaching along with literature, is also a presenter of Pathibhara FM and Himashikhar Television in Jhapa. B.N. Pustak Sansar Pvt Limited is the publisher and editor of the book is Rajkumar Bania. Unika, published in 2072 BS, is priced at Rs.

The cover of the book is decorated with a picture of a yellow bird flying on a branch of a thorn - by the Fine Art Center. The entire novel, which is divided into 32 parts, has only 258 pages and the last two pages express gratitude on behalf of the author. Inside the last cover is a brief introduction with a picture of the author. Entering the novel, there is another novel within the novel. The author has become a reader and is reading Unika's novel, which has been announced to be awarded the Madan Award. Some works are in the news for a few days after they are published, and some are sold out and sold out. When a work is awarded a prestigious prize, it gains market share and readership. At the beginning of this story I present the character as a reader. As the character I announced the Madan Award for Unika's novel, he decides to read it because the work is popular and starts reading it. In the middle of the story, the love story of Unika and Samik is presented. The beginning of the story is composed in the Purvadipti method and after twenty-eight episodes, the story is re-arranged and moved forward. Seen in this way, it seems that this novel has been composed in a mixed format. The original story is in the middle. Dedicated to those who love, it is easy to understand that this work is based on a love story. In the sixties, when the development of social media was not as fast as it is now and the exchange of messages and phone conversations between boyfriends and girlfriends through mobile phones, the situation of that time is also reflected in the story. The author has advanced the ups and downs of love in a series of ways. In the middle of the story, he has also inserted his ghazal personality according to the context - by mentioning the lions of ghazal. The author presents the moment of reunion and separation in a way that makes the reader happy and sad. In the last part of the story, I read that the character's own love story is a popular novel and its real author is a friend of Samik, but the story of Unika ends with the fact that others have taken advantage of it. In the novel, Unika is the main female character and Samik is the main male character. Their love is connecting and breaking up three times. After falling in love for the third time, Samik left the capital and reached Jhapa and started living a well-organized life in Jhapa. Between Unika and Samik, sometimes the landlord, sometimes the younger (Unika's sister) seems to be present. After going to Jhapa, the love of Unika and Samik grows once again. They get ready to get married and when the father does not approve of the marriage, the love breaks down again. In this way, both the characters seem to be accepting the ups and downs of reunion and separation with the situation. In the end, Samik arrives in Kathmandu to fight the last battle for his love. After many attempts to talk to Unika but failed, the story ends with Unika's flower being with another boy that Unika likes. In the last part of the story, I read that the character's own love story is a famous novel and its real author is a friend of Samik's, but the story of Unika ends with the fact that others have taken advantage of it. Originally written from a first-person perspective, the language of the novel is very simple and communicative. Although the work is called 'Buckpatra of a mad lover', it is not only Samik's one-sided presentation here, a lot of things have been said about him through Unika, but also an attempt has been made to present Unika's thoughts a little through the entrance. But what did she really think on behalf of Unica in this love story? Why play such a game? As it is incomplete, it is limited to one-sided expression. Here it seems that the author has not been able to present both the characters with justice. The surroundings of this story are Maiti Devi, Ghattekulo, Kalimati, Kuleshwor, Swayambhu, Balaju, Godavari, etc. of Kathmandu, while Birtamod and Charali of Jhapa are also included. It seems that the lifestyle of the youths living and studying in Kathmandu is also tried to be included in this story. Although there is no explanation of the wholeness of life, this work has got the full form of the novel.

The author presents the moment of reunion and separation in a way that makes the reader happy and sad. In the last part of the story, I read that the character's own love story is a popular novel and its real author is a friend of Samik, but the story of Unika ends with the fact that others have taken advantage of it. In the novel, Unika is the main female character and Samik is the main male character. Their love is connecting and breaking up three times. After falling in love for the third time, Samik left the capital and reached Jhapa and started living a well-organized life in Jhapa. Between Unika and Samik, sometimes the landlord, sometimes the younger (Unika's sister) seems to be present. After going to Jhapa, the love of Unika and Samik grows once again. They get ready to get married and when the father does not approve of the marriage, the love breaks down again. In this way, both the characters seem to be accepting the ups and downs of reunion and separation with the situation. In the end, Samik arrives in Kathmandu to fight the last battle for his love. After many attempts to talk to Unika but failed, the story ends with Unika's flower being with another boy that Unika likes. In the last part of the story, I read that the character's own love story is a famous novel and its real author is a friend of Samik's, but the story of Unika ends with the fact that others have taken advantage of it. Originally written from a first-person perspective, the language of the novel is very simple and communicative. Although the work is called 'Buckpatra of a mad lover', it is not only Samik's one-sided presentation here, a lot of things have been said about him through Unika, but also an attempt has been made to present Unika's thoughts a little through the entrance. But what did she really think on behalf of Unica in this love story? Why play such a game? As it is incomplete, it is limited to one-sided expression. Here it seems that the author has not been able to present both the characters with justice. The surroundings of this story are Maiti Devi, Ghattekulo, Kalimati, Kuleshwor, Swayambhu, Balaju, Godavari, etc. of Kathmandu, while Birtamod and Charali of Jhapa are also included. It seems that the lifestyle of the youths living and studying in Kathmandu is also tried to be included in this story. Although there is no explanation of the wholeness of life, this work has got the full form of the novel.

Dedicated to those who love is a crazy lover's book - 'Unica' novel. This is the first narrative work of Ghanshyam Pathik, a poet and ghazal writer who has made a name for himself in the field of poetry and ghazal. Two collections of ghazals, 'Shahar Timro Bhaye' and 'Bhool Zindagi Ko' and a collection of poems 'Pahelo Phool O Swapna' are the works published before Pathik's novel. Pathik Damak, who is also involved in teaching along with literature, is also a presenter of Pathibhara FM and Himashikhar Television in Jhapa. B.N. Pustak Sansar Pvt Limited is the publisher and editor of the book is Rajkumar Bania. Unika, published in 2072 BS, is priced at Rs. Listen Yunika Novel with Achyut Ghimire from Ujyaalo 90 Network Radio program Shruti sambeg. Listen Yunika You can listen Yunika in Hamro Awaz. Select episode and listen Yunika. Full Episodes of Yunika To Download Right Click the link and Save link as to your computer Full Episodes of Yunika Yunika part 1 Yunika part 2 Yunika part 3 Yunika part 4 Yunika part 5 Yunika part 6 Yunika part 7 Yunika part 8 Yunika part 9 These Audio of Yunika are taken from Archive.org which is uploaded by Shrabya Kitab. The cover of the book is decorated with a picture of a yellow bird flying on a branch of a thorn - by the Fine Art Center. The entire novel, which is divided into 32 parts, has only 258 pages and the last two pages express gratitude on behalf of the author. Inside the last cover is a brief introduction with a picture of the author. Entering the novel, there is another novel within the novel. The author has become a reader and is reading Unika's novel, which has been announced to be awarded the Madan Award. Some works are in the news for a few days after they are published, and some are sold out and sold out. When a work is awarded a prestigious prize, it gains market share and readership. At the beginning of this story I present the character as a reader. As the character I announced the Madan Award for Unika's novel, he decides to read it because the work is popular and starts reading it. In the middle of the story, the love story of Unika and Samik is presented. The beginning of the story is composed in the Purvadipti method and after twenty-eight episodes, the story is re-arranged and moved forward. Seen in this way, it seems that this novel has been composed in a mixed format. The original story is in the middle. Dedicated to those who love, it is easy to understand that this work is based on a love story. In the sixties, when the development of social media was not as fast as it is now and the exchange of messages and phone conversations between boyfriends and girlfriends through mobile phones, the situation of that time is also reflected in the story. The author has advanced the ups and downs of love in a series of ways. In the middle of the story, he has also inserted his ghazal personality according to the context - by mentioning the lions of ghazal. The author presents the moment of reunion and separation in a way that makes the reader happy and sad. In the last part of the story, I read that the character's own love story is a popular novel and its real author is a friend of Samik, but the story of Unika ends with the fact that others have taken advantage of it. In the novel, Unika is the main female character and Samik is the main male character. Their love is connecting and breaking up three times. After falling in love for the third time, Samik left the capital and reached Jhapa and started living a well-organized life in Jhapa. Between Unika and Samik, sometimes the landlord, sometimes the younger (Unika's sister) seems to be present. After going to Jhapa, the love of Unika and Samik grows once again. They get ready to get married and when the father does not approve of the marriage, the love breaks down again. In this way, both the characters seem to be accepting the ups and downs of reunion and separation with the situation. In the end, Samik arrives in Kathmandu to fight the last battle for his love. After many attempts to talk to Unika but failed, the story ends with Unika's flower being with another boy that Unika likes. In the last part of the story, I read that the character's own love story is a famous novel and its real author is a friend of Samik's, but the story of Unika ends with the fact that others have taken advantage of it. Originally written from a first-person perspective, the language of the novel is very simple and communicative. Although the work is called 'Buckpatra of a mad lover', it is not only Samik's one-sided presentation here, a lot of things have been said about him through Unika, but also an attempt has been made to present Unika's thoughts a little through the entrance. But what did she really think on behalf of Unica in this love story? Why play such a game? As it is incomplete, it is limited to one-sided expression. Here it seems that the author has not been able to present both the characters with justice. The surroundings of this story are Maiti Devi, Ghattekulo, Kalimati, Kuleshwor, Swayambhu, Balaju, Godavari, etc. of Kathmandu, while Birtamod and Charali of Jhapa are also included. It seems that the lifestyle of the youths living and studying in Kathmandu is also tried to be included in this story. Although there is no explanation of the wholeness of life, this work has got the full form of the novel.
